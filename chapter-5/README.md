# Real-World-Implementation-of-C-Design-Patterns
## Chapter 5 Sample Code
The code in this repository comes from my book on C# patterns.  Organizing a set of files and projects
with dependencies between each other in Visual Studio or Rider is pretty easy.  However, the structure
created by the IDE is a virtual structure and not a physical structure.  By this, I mean when you make a solution
folder in the IDE and group a set of projects together, as I do with each chapter's code, it won't appear
the same way in your file explorer as it does in the solution explorer within your IDE.  By extension, this means
links from the chapter's text to the chapter's code in github won't work well either, because GitHub doesn't understand how
to display virtual folders.

So to make this work, I left the virtual folder structure intact and created physical folders with links to the
chapter code.  Its the best of both worlds.  If you open the book's solution file you'll see the chapter code
delineated by chapter, which is again, a virtual structure.  When you browse in GitHub from the links in the text,
you'll find a set of files like this one that map the physical structure to the virtual structure used by the IDE.

## In this chapter
This chapter deals with a class of patterns known as *Behavioral Patterns*.  This group of patterns helps define expressive ways to
define the behavior of the objects within your project.
