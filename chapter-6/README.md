# Real-World-Implementation-of-C-Design-Patterns
## Chapter 6 Sample Code
The code in this repository comes from my book on C# patterns.  Organizing a set of files and projects with dependencies between each other in Visual Studio or Rider is pretty easy.  However, the structure created by the IDE is a virtual structure and not a physical structure.  By this, I mean when you make a solution folder in the IDE and group a set of projects together, as I do with each chapter's code, it won't appear the same way in your file explorer as it does in the solution explorer within your IDE.  By extension, this means links from the chapter's text to the chapter's code in github won't work well either, because GitHub doesn't understand how to display virtual folders.

So to make this work, I left the virtual folder structure intact and created physical folders with links to the chapter code.  Its the best of both worlds.  If you open the book's solution file you'll see the chapter code delineated by chapter, which is again, a virtual structure.  When you browse in GitHub from the links in the text, you'll find a set of files like this one that map the physical structure to the virtual structure used by the IDE.

## In this chapter
In this chapter, we switch gears.  We begin with a furtherance of the story we've been telling in the previous three chapters, but this chapter presents a plot-twist.  Kitty and Phoebe are faced with a harrowing turn of events that threatens to derail their dreams of opening their own automated bicycle factory.

I won't spoil it here, but this chapter is all about planning a new project from the beginning using patterns and UML diagrams. As such, there are no code projects since those are deferred to the next chapter.  I'm trying to instill in the reader the virtue of planning object oriented projects before writing code.  It's easier, less inexpensive, and timelier to change a diagram than it is to rewrite code.  While I don't necessarily advocate, nor do I demonstrate within the chapter, many UML design tools are capable of generating much of the code you'd need based on the diagram.  If you're new to OOP, I recommend you type your code the old-fashioned way.  You'll learn more effectively not only from the exercise of typing, but also from correcting your mistakes along the way versus having a tool generate the code for you.
